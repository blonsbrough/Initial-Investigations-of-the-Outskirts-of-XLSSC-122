This folder contains the reduction pipeline scripts involved in the creation of a photometric and spectroscopic catalogue of cluster members in the galaxy cluster XLSSC 122 using the Hubble Space Telescope.

Pipeline spans from the raw data download from My Space Telescope, to the stitching together of the cluster catalogue.

Scripts contain several intermediate steps not included, described, or shown in (Lonsbrough et al. 2025).
