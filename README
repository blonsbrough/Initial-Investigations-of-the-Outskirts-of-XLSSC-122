This repository contains the reduced data for the paper "Initial Investigations of the Outskirts of XLSSC 122"
This includes spectroscopically identified member galaxy catalogues and associated spectra
Spectroscopic information made using the G141 grizm on HST/WFC3/IR
Photometric information made using the F814W filter on HST/ACS/WFC, F105W/F140W filters on HST/WFC3/IR

The detailed reduction steps are outlined in (Lonsbrough et al, 2025)

There is a folder for each cluster, XLSSC 122 and CLJ021741.1-034546, containing raw spectra and the reduced catalogue
For all objects not identified as a member of the cluster, see the 2 files in the primary directory. !!!Warning, these objects were not given as much care as those in the reduced catalogues, use with caution!!!
